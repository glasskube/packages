shortDescription: Kubernetes Metrics Server
longDescription: >
  Metrics Server is a scalable, efficient source of container resource metrics
  for Kubernetes built-in autoscaling pipelines.

  Metrics Server collects resource metrics from Kubelets and exposes them in Kubernetes apiserver through Metrics API
  for use by Horizontal Pod Autoscaler and Vertical Pod Autoscaler. Metrics API can also be accessed by kubectl top,
  making it easier to debug autoscaling pipelines.

  Metrics Server is not meant for non-autoscaling purposes. For example, donâ€™t use it to forward metrics to monitoring
  solutions, or as a source of monitoring solution metrics. In such cases please collect metrics from Kubelet
  /metrics/resource endpoint directly.

  Metrics Server offers:

   - A single deployment that works on most clusters (see Requirements)
   - Fast autoscaling, collecting metrics every 15 seconds.
   - Resource efficiency, using 1 mili core of CPU and 2 MB of memory for each node in a cluster.
   - Scalable support up to 5,000 node clusters.
