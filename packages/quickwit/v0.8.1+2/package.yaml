name: quickwit
shortDescription: Cloud-native search engine for observability
longDescription: |
  > _**PLEASE READ:** If you previously installed this package as a `ClusterPackage`, please remove and install it as a
  > namespace-scoped `Package` instead._

  Quickwit is the first engine to execute complex search and analytics queries directly on cloud storage with
  sub-second latency. Powered by Rust and its decoupled compute and storage architecture, it is designed to be
  resource-efficient, easy to operate, and scale to petabytes of data.

  Quickwit is a great fit for log management, distributed tracing, and generally immutable data such as conversational
  data (emails, texts, messaging platforms) and event-based analytics.

  Make sure that the object storage user has all permissions (e.g. `"s3:*"`) for the configured bucket.
  For more information make sure to check out the Quickwit documentation.
